# Synth Forum

This is a single-page forum app, based on Reddit, that I made with Ember.js and Rails 5.
Features include:

* Users can register for new accounts.
* Registered users can manage their profiles.
* Registered users can create and edit topics in forums.
* Registered users can create and edit posts in topics.
* Registered users can reply to topics and posts.
* Registered users can save topics.
* Registered users can upvote or downvote topics.
* Registered users can send messages to other registered users.
* Admins can manage all user accounts, forums, topics, and posts.
* Admins can create new forums. Regular users cannot (sorry).
